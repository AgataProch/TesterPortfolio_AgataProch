# Tester Portfolio – Agata Procházková

This repository collects my practical work from the **Czechitas Digital Academy: Testing** program.  
It demonstrates my skills across several key areas of software testing – manual, API, SQL, and web.

## Structure

- **Web (HTML, CSS; VS Code) - folder docs**  
  Simple webpage built and tested as part of frontend testing practice ([web](https://agataproch.github.io/TesterPortfolio_AgataProch/)).

- **API (Postman)**  
  Postman collections for testing various endpoints – includes authentication, negative scenarios, and status code validation.

- **Database (SQL; DBeaver)**  
  SQL queries and exercises – joins, aggregations, and data validation examples.

- **Automation (IntelliJ IDEA – Low-code framework)**  
  Low-code UI automation project built on a predefined educational framework.  
  My main work is in LowCodeAutomationTest.java, where I created and executed end-to-end UI scenarios (navigation, form filling, payment selection, validations).
